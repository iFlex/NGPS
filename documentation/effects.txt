Way to store effects

effects : {
  GEM_TRIGGER_EVENT:{
    delegated: Boolean,
    chaining: Boolean,
    chainIndex: int,
    fx:[fx,fx,fx, ...]
  }
}

fx:{
  fxname:String,
  UID:Container ID,
  parameters:[],
  initialState:{},
  initAtExecutionOnly: boolean flat, tells preview to not call init after the preview is finished ( so that certain effects don't hide containers when editing for example)
}

//STORAGE for effects
fxname : {
  fxname:Unique String Id of effect, must be the same as the key under which this record is stored
  name:Display name of effect, //display name, fxname is the referencing one
  description:String description of effect,
  install_steps:["Install step 1 message for user","Second install step for user","Compelted!"],
  install:function(trigger,triggerer,target),
  configure:function(fx), //called the same number of times as elements in install_steps - every time it does soething else
  uninstall:function(trigger,triggerer,fx), //removes effect
  execute:function(descriptor,onFinished), //executes effect on target
  initialise:function(descriptor) //puts target in initial status and sets up cover container if effect is delegated
}

***!! - the execute has a callback onFinished that is called then the animation has ended
