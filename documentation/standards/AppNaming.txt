How to name your application depending on what type of app it is:

Types of apps:
0. Internal
1. Global
2. Local

Internal app names must start with an underscore _

Global apps are services that facilitate functionality, they are concerned with multiple containers not just one
application_name.g - must contain the suffix g

Local apps are concerned with just one container - they add functionality to that container only
application_name.l - should contain the suffix l but can be omited

Applications that can be loaded both locally and globally:

application_name.gl or .lg
