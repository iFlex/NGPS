NGPS application standards

Types of applications:
1. Lightweight continuous apps
2. Heavyweight apps

1. Are apps that run continuously inside a div.
They are used for functions requiring a mild amount of rendering and computation
2. Are apps that can be as complex as a website.
These are carefully loaded / unloaded and ran only when on screen and requested by the user

Problem: Input
Input will be hard to divert to the app and from the app back to NGPS
*Solution:
	When user is not interacting with the app:
		container will have an configurable div (default = invisible) covering it: 
			that div facilitates: moving,resizing,rotating, etc
			if div is clicked then it becomes hidden and the app gains control of the events
	When user is interacting with the app:
		any click outside the container will quit the interaction mode causing the app to suspend
		there will be a small configurable icon ( div ) on the screen that will let the container
		regain control of the events by shoing the above mentioned div again

Standard For 1. Apps:
*	Are mainly JS & CSS based
*	Must be structured as a class in order to have multiple instances and be bond to containers
*	Must have a constructor with the same name as the plugin that creates the objects
*	Must have methods:
		init
		load
		store
		show
		hide

*	May handle events:
		onFocus
		onLoseFocus
